/* 
 * Group Reflection
 * During this assignment, the team had to navigate the six problems and develop methods to solve each unique problem with the desired output. 
 * You can see from the github code and the picture of outcomes that we met the desired outcomes and thought through the problems. It was not enough 
 * to simply get the desire outcome, but had to work to design the logic of the code to run through loops to systematically reach the desired endstate. 
 * As you can see, we developed several stored procedures to run the complex calculations/loops that enabled us to cleanly display our six cases of code. 
 * We worked together to ensure we added comments to explain logic, and we learned a great deal from working with the varying degrees of talent and experience 
 * on our team.  
 * For the assignment next year, we can only offer that there should be more clarification on problem #5, as we struggled to understand the exact nature 
 * of the intersection. This could be a little more clear. But all in all, this was a great first assignment to get our feet under us.
